Weekly Exercise #5: Matrix Class

Included files: matrix.cpp, matrix.h, we5_test.cpp, Makefile, README

Running instructions: In the directory containing the file Makefile and submission_validator.py, type make to run the code. OR compile all 3 required files matrix.cpp, matrix.h and we5_test.cpp, and then run the output file (.o file) of those 3.

Makefile targets: 
    - make (we5_solution): compiles all the required files in one executable file 'we5_solution'.
    - make we5_test.o: creates an object file for we5_test.cpp.
    - make matrix.o: creates an object file for matrix.cpp and matrix.h.
    - make clean: Removes all object files and executables.
