Weekly Exercise #6: Graph Concepts

Included files: graph_concepts.cpp, digraph.h, digraph.cpp, Makefile, README

Running instructions: In the directory containing the file Makefile and submission_validator.py, type make to run the code. OR compile all 3 required files graph_concepts.cpp, digraph.h and digraph.cpp, and then run the output file (.o file) of those 3. To take the input from a text file, type "output file" < "name of the text file". For example we6_solution < edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt.

Makefile targets: 
    - make we6_solution: compiles all the required files in one executable file 'we6_solution'.
    - make digraph.o: creates an object file for digraph.cpp and digraph.h.
    - make graph_concepts.o: creates an object file for graph_concepts.cpp.
    - make clean: Removes all object files and executables.

Notes: Code for function "void dfs(const Digraph &graph, const int u, const int prev, unordered_map<int, int> &reached)" is taken from the lecture 13 in-class discussion.
